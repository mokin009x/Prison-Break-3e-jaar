# Prison-Break-3e-jaar
prison break project with use of modules from sintlucasallstarts/prison break

first things first my apikey that I need to use needs to be refreshed every 24 ours. 
So David if you review my project after this time period I have recorded a short video and uploaded it to youtube

Quick check list of what I do have to a certain extent at least
///check 
*Create an abstract class Item with a name and a weight
*Create two types of items:
*AccessItem: keeps an extra int that has the id of the door it opens.
*BonusItem: keeps the amount of points you get for this item.
*Create a MonoBehaviour derived class Inventory that keeps a List and caches the total weight.
*The Inventory should only allow to add items if the total weight does not pass the MaximumWeight.
*Create a level where you need to find a key and optionally some hidden objects to get points.(dont have hidden objects)
*Do not create a way to open the last door. That's for the next assignment.

---------MY SILLY EXCUSES PART--------
I had a difficult time understanding your scripts to its fullest extent. This made it so my programming speed slowed down even more than it already is.
And I was too bothered with how things looked in my game and took to much time creating models and thinking about the layout of my prison instead of creating functionality.
most of the people used assets packs I choose not to what also slowed my progress down. all in hindsight.


if you actually read all of this thank you and have a nice day.
